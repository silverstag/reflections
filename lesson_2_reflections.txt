What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I think Git would build a tree of information regarding the directory and store metadata
related to everything in the given directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is for pooling logically related files together. It is temporary and 
is visible only until a commit is done. Unlike working directory, staging area
ceases to exit once a commit is done.
